I created a sample of school management system using javascript Classes, Modules, Maps and more.
It was an assignment in TBC IT Academy bootcamp.
The system is built on CRUD model, it consists of five major Modules and allows you to add,
edit, remove or update subjects, students, teachers, groups, classes an so on.
